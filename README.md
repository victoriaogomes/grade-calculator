# Grade Calculator 

Grade calculator is a simple app developed in Kotlin in which you can calculate your grade average and discover if you were approved or not. To do that, you have to provide two grades and you number of absences in this discipline. We have four possible situations:

- The student can be approved
- The student can be reproved by grade
- The student can be reproved by the number of absences
- The student can be reproved by grade and number of absenses
